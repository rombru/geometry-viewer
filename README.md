# Geometry Viewer

This repository contains an Intellij plugin named Geometry Viewer.
The JTS & WKT Geometry Viewer plugin enhances your development experience
by providing a tool to visualize JTS (Java Topology Suite) and WKT (Well-Known Text) geometries directly within IntelliJ IDEA.
Integrated into the debug mode,
this plugin adds a context menu action that allows you to view geometric data on an interactive map,
making it easier to understand and debug spatial data.
